There is 6.6 minutes to showcase what we have.
That is 2-3 minutes for each slide. You should have 3-4 for team memeber for a total of 20 minutes.

* Team  
    * Aly
    * Finnian
    * Arran

### Main Libraries
* Pyplot
* Sklearn
* Yellowbrick
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Xgboost
* Scipy

## Questions - outputs to predict
* Q1 - Implement a prediction model for "Qualität"​​
    * Qualität - Quality
* Q1.1 - Implement a prediction model for "Warpfaktor"
    * Warp factor
* Q2 - Implement a prediction model for "Fehler"​
    * Errors
* Q2.1 - implement a prediction model for "Gammawert"
    * Gamma value
* Q3- Implement a prediction model for "LScore"​
    * LScore - Custom grade score
* Q3.1 XKlasse
    * Class of the product

### Findings
* It is possible to predict LScore with at 93%  
* Quality at a 95% and WarpFaktor at 99%  
* It is **not** possible to predict XKlasse  
* It is possible to predict Fehler at 88%  
* It is possible to predict Gammawert  
#### Other notes
* Implement other inputs from suppliers for more data.  
* All results are currently based on input values. They could be updated during the production process.
