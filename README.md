### Main Libraries
* Pyplot
* Sklearn
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Xgboost
* Scipy

## Questions - outputs to predict
* Q1 - Implement a prediction model for "weight_in_kg"​​
    * weight_in_kg
* Q2.1 - implement a prediction model for "error"
    * XGBClassifier & RandomForestClassifier
* Q2.2- Implement a prediction model for "error-type"​
    * RandomForestClassifier
* Q3 - Implement a prediction model for "Quality"
    * RandomForestRegressor
* Q4 - Implement a prediction model for "reflectionScore"​
    * LinearRegression & ConfusionMatrix
* Q5 - Implement a prediction model for "nicesness"​
    * LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegression, XGBoostRegression

### Key Findings
* It is possible to predict error with the highest accuracy of 92%

* It is possible to predict whether there is an error or not before production

* Predicting weight in kg and error with high accuracy can optimise manufacturing processes, control costs and ensure quality. Preventing errors before production can save    the company up to 86.67% in costs
